    abstract = "{With significant recent advancements in thermal sciences—such as the development of new theoretical and experimental techniques, and the discovery of new transport mechanisms—it is helpful to revisit the fundamentals of vibrational heat conduction to formulate an updated and informed physical understanding. The increasing maturity of simulation and modeling methods sparks the desire to leverage these techniques to rapidly improve and develop technology through digital engineering and multi-scale, electro-thermal models. With that vision in mind, this review attempts to build a holistic understanding of thermal transport by focusing on the often unaddressed relationships between subfields, which can be critical for multi-scale modeling approaches. For example, we outline the relationship between mode-specific (computational) and spectral (analytical) models. We relate thermal boundary resistance models based on perturbation approaches and classic transmissivity based models. We discuss the relationship between lattice dynamics and molecular dynamics approaches along with two-channel transport frameworks that have emerged recently and that connect crystal-like and amorphous-like heat conduction. Throughout, we discuss best practices for modeling experimental data and outline how these models can guide material-level and system-level design.}",

	abstract = {Charge transport in semiconducting polymers ranges from localized (hopping-like) to delocalized (metal-like), yet no quantitative model exists to fully capture this transport spectrum and its dependency on charge carrier density. In this study, using an archetypal polymer--dopant system, we measure the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and extent of oxidation. We then use these measurements to develop a semi-localized transport (SLoT) model, which captures both localized and delocalized transport contributions. By applying the SLoT model to published data, we demonstrate its broad utility. We are able to determine system-dependent parameters such as the maximum localization energy of the system, how this localization energy changes with doping, the amount of dopant required to achieve metal-like conductivity and the conductivity a system could have in the absence of localization effects. This proposed SLoT model improves our ability to predict and tailor electronic properties of doped semiconducting polymers.},

abstract = {Abstract The influence of micro/nanostructure on thermal conductivity is a topic of great scientific interest, particularly to thermoelectrics. The current understanding is that structural defects decrease thermal conductivity through phonon scattering where the phonon dispersion and speed of sound are assumed to remain constant. Experimental work on a PbTe model system is presented, which shows that the speed of sound linearly decreases with increased internal strain. This softening of the materials lattice completely accounts for the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity, without the introduction of additional phonon scattering mechanisms. Additionally, it is shown that a major contribution to the improvement in the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT > 2) of high-efficiency Na-doped PbTe can be attributed to lattice softening. While inhomogeneous internal strain fields are known to introduce phonon scattering centers, this study demonstrates that internal strain can modify phonon propagation speed as well. This presents new avenues to control lattice thermal conductivity, beyond phonon scattering. In practice, many engineering materials will exhibit both softening and scattering effects, as is shown in silicon. This work shines new light on studies of thermal conductivity in fields of energy materials, microelectronics, and nanoscale heat transfer.},
