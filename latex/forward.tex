\chapter*{Forward}
This is \emph{not} a full thesis template! It only demonstrates how to create per-chapter references using the \texttt{chapterbib} package with BibTeX. (Do not use with BibLaTeX!)

Each chapter must be in its own \texttt{.tex} file and \texttt{include}-d into the main \texttt{.tex} file. If compiling on your own machine, run \texttt{bibtex} on \emph{each} generated \texttt{.aux} file, before running \texttt{pdflatex} twice more. (These are done automatically on Overleaf.)
